  "response": "You can build muscle without significant weight gain by focusing on strength training and a slight caloric surplus.  Don't fear the scale; muscle weighs more than fat.\n\nA basic plan involves 3 full-body workouts per week, incorporating compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, and rows.  Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions.  Prioritize progressive overload â€“ gradually increasing weight or reps each week.\n\nNutrition is key.  Consume enough protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight) to support muscle growth.  Focus on lean protein sources, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n\nTo create a personalized plan, tell me your age, weight, height, and your specific muscle-building goal (e.g., increase strength, improve physique).  Then we can tailor a program to your needs.\n",
