  "response": "Gaining weight healthily requires a calorie surplus.  We need to eat more calories than you burn.  Focus on nutrient-dense foods:  lean proteins (chicken, fish, beans), complex carbohydrates (brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes), and healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil).  Increase portion sizes gradually.  Strength training is crucial for building muscle mass. Aim for 2-3 sessions per week, focusing on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.\n\nTo create a personalized plan, I need some information: your age, current weight, height, and your ideal weight gain goal (e.g., 1 pound per week).  Also, tell me about your current diet and exercise routine.  Let's work together to build a safe and effective plan.\n",
