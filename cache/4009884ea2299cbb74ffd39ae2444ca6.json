  "response": "At 21, you have plenty of time to build healthy habits.  Focus on a balanced approach:\n\n* **Strength Training:** Aim for 2-3 sessions/week, targeting all major muscle groups.  Think squats, push-ups, rows, lunges.\n\n* **Cardio:**  Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio weekly (brisk walking, jogging, cycling).\n\n* **Nutrition:** Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.  Limit sugary drinks and processed snacks.\n\nTo create a personalized plan, I need more information.  Tell me your:\n\n* Age (you said 21, but confirming helps)\n* Weight\n* Height\n* Fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, improved endurance)\n\n\nOnce I have this, I can tailor a program to your specific needs.\n",
