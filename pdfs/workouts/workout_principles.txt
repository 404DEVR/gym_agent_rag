WORKOUT PRINCIPLES AND PROGRAMMING

PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD
- Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets over time
- 2.5-5% weight increase when you can complete all sets with good form
- Add 1-2 reps per set when weight increase isn't possible

TRAINING FREQUENCY
- Beginners: 2-3 full body sessions per week
- Intermediate: 3-4 sessions, upper/lower or push/pull/legs
- Advanced: 4-6 sessions, body part splits possible

REST AND RECOVERY
- 48-72 hours between training same muscle groups
- 7-9 hours sleep for optimal recovery
- Deload weeks every 4-6 weeks (reduce volume by 40-50%)

COMPOUND VS ISOLATION
Compound Exercises (prioritize):
- Squats: Quads, glutes, core
- Deadlifts: Hamstrings, glutes, back, traps
- Bench Press: Chest, shoulders, triceps
- Pull-ups: Lats, rhomboids, biceps
- Overhead Press: Shoulders, triceps, core

Isolation Exercises (supplement):
- Bicep curls, tricep extensions
- Lateral raises, calf raises
- Leg curls, leg extensions

REP RANGES AND GOALS
Strength (1-5 reps):
- 85-95% 1RM
- 3-5 sets
- 3-5 minutes rest

Hypertrophy (6-12 reps):
- 65-85% 1RM
- 3-4 sets
- 1-3 minutes rest

Endurance (12+ reps):
- 50-65% 1RM
- 2-3 sets
- 30-90 seconds rest

PERIODIZATION
Linear Periodization:
- Start light, gradually increase intensity
- Good for beginners

Undulating Periodization:
- Vary intensity and volume within weeks
- Good for intermediate/advanced

WARM-UP PROTOCOL
1. 5-10 minutes light cardio
2. Dynamic stretching
3. Movement-specific warm-up sets
4. Gradually increase to working weight
